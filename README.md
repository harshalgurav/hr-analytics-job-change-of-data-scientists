# Context
This dataset was created throguh HR analysis to examine which potential employees still want to work for the company after training. Many employees will take company training only to go choose to work somewhere else.

# Goal
Through binary classification, we can predict which employees will stay with the company after training. And wtih this information we can reduce the cost and time of training, while increasing quality and better plan courses based on candidates that are potential hires. And to evaluate these predictions, accuracy would be a decent evaluator as there is not a high cost associated particularly with false positives or particularly false negatives (Unlike cases like fraud, where we'd be more concerend with false negatives than false positives).
